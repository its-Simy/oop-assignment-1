 * Before 1961, people living in Great Britain had to deal with a pretty complicated currency consisting of pounds sterling, shillings, pence, farthings, and other coins. The currency system worked like this:
• 1 pound sterling = 20 shillings
• 1 shilling = 12 pence (“pence” is the plural of “penny”) 
• 1 penny = 4 farthings
Write a program (ShowMeTheMoney.java) that reads in a single integer, the number of farthings, and then prints a sequence of integers that represents the fewest number of each bill or coin needed to represent that amount, starting with the largest denomination. (Hint: use the integer division and the % operator.)
For example, if the argument is 2563 farthings, then the program prints 2 pounds sterling, 13 shillings, 4 pence and 3 farthings because 2,563 farthings is equivalent to 2 pounds sterling, 13 shillings, 4 pence and 3 farthings.
Examples:
Enter in the number of farthings: 2563
Pound Sterling 2
Shilling 13
Penny 4
Farthings 3
 
Enter in the number of farthings: 4900
Pound Sterling 5
Shilling 2
Penny 1
Farthings 0
 
Enter in the number of farthings: 762
Pound Sterling 0
Shilling 15
Penny 10
Farthings 2

/*
 * Pentagonal numbers are a sequence of integers where the nth integer in the sequence is defined as
n*(3n−1)/2
For example, the fourth pentagonal number (n = 4) is equal to 22 because n*(3n−1)/2 = 4*(3*4−1)/2 = 4*11/2=22. Write a program which reads a single positive integer argument and returns the corresponding pentagonal number, which also must be an integer. 
Examples
Enter n: 3
Pentagonal number: 12
 
Enter n: 7
Pentagonal number: 70

Enter n: 11
Pentagonal number: 176

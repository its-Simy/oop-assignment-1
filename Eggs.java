/*
Stony Brook Dairy Farm sells organic brown eggs to local customers. It charges $3.25 for a dozen eggs, or 45 cents for individual eggs that are not part of a dozen. Write a program that prompts a user for the number of eggs in the order and then display the amount owed with a full explanation. Example:
Number of eggs in the order: 27  
You ordered 27 eggs. That’s 2 dozen (2 x 12 = 24 eggs) at $3.25 per dozen (2 x $3.25 = $6.50) and 3 loose eggs at 45 cents (3 x 45c = $1.35) for a total of $7.85 ($6.50 + $1.35 = $7.85).

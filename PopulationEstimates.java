/*
 * The webcomic xkcd gives the following formula to approximate the United States population for a given year (from 2000 onward):
Obtain the last two digits of the year (for example, 2017 would give you 17)
Subtract 10 from this value
Multiply the result by 3
Add 310
This gives the approximate U.S. population in millions of people.
Write a program that takes an integer representing a four-digit year as its single argument and prints an integer corresponding to the estimated U.S. population for that year in millions.
Examples
Enter a year: 2030
Population estimate (millions of people): 370
Â 
Enter a year: 2050
Population estimate (millions of people): 430

Total: 70 points (10 points for each problem)
